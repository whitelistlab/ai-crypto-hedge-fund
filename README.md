# AI Crypto Hedge Fund

This is a proof of concept for an AI-powered hedge fund.  The goal of this project is to explore the use of AI to make trading decisions.  This project is for **educational** purposes only and is not intended for real trading or investment.

Special Disclaimer:
**This project does not endorse any crypto currency (like AI Agent Meme) and will not be used as a base for any crypto currency.**

This system employs several agents working together:

1. Valuation Agent - Calculates the intrinsic value of a stock and generates trading signals
2. Sentiment Agent - Analyzes market sentiment and generates trading signals
3. Fundamentals Agent - Analyzes fundamental data and generates trading signals
4. Technical Analyst - Analyzes technical indicators and generates trading signals
5. Risk Manager - Calculates risk metrics and sets position limits
6. Portfolio Manager - Makes final trading decisions and generates orders

Note: the system simulates trading decisions, it does not actually trade.

## Setup

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/whitelistlab/ai-crypto-hedge-fund.git
cd ai-crypto-hedge-fund
```

1. Install Poetry (if not already installed):
```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
poetry install
```

3. Set up your environment variables:
```bash
# Create .env file for your API keys
cp .env.example .env
```

Set the API keys in the .env file:
```
# Get your OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

# Get your Financial Datasets API key from https://financialdatasets.ai/
FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY=your-financial-datasets-api-key
```

**Important**: You must to set the OpenAI API key for the hedge fund to work.

Financial data for AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, NVDA, and TSLA is free and does not require an API key.

For any other ticker, you will need to set the `FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY` in the .env file.

## Usage

### Running the Hedge Fund
```bash
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA
```

You can also specify a `--show-reasoning` flag to print the reasoning of each agent to the console.

```bash
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker AAPL --show-reasoning
```
You can optionally specify the start and end dates to make decisions for a specific time period.

```bash
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --start-date 2024-01-01 --end-date 2024-03-01 
```

### Running the Backtester

```bash
poetry run python src/backtester.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA
```

You can optionally specify the start and end dates to backtest over a specific time period.

```bash
